 All new code files containing React components or logic MUST use the `.tsx` extension and be written in TypeScript.

 All new React components MUST be functional components that utilize hooks for state and side effects. The use of class components is strictly forbidden.

 File and folder naming must adhere to the project conventions:
      - Component files: PascalCase (`MyComponent.tsx`).
      - Directories and API routes: kebab-case (`/our-partnership-model`).
